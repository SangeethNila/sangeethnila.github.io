        <h1>Sangeeth Kochanthara</h1>
        <br>

         <p> I am a computer scientist specializing in the systems aspect of software engineering at <a href="https://astron.nl">ASTRON, </a> the Netherlands’ space agency. I hold an adjunct position at TU Eindhoven, where I supervise PhD and masters students. </p> 


      <p> I earned my doctorate at TU Eindhoven. My dissertation won two national awards for Best Dissertation from <a href="https://www.versen.nl">the Dutch National Association for Software Engineering</a> and <a href="https://ipa.win.tue.nl">the Institute for Programming Research and Algorithmics,</a> a national inter-university research school. My masters thesis received a gold medal (best thesis award) from IIIT-Delhi.</p> 


        <p>My research lies at the intersection of data analytics, machine learning, and empirical software engineering. My interdisciplinary projects have applied software engineering to the automotive sector, real-time systems, radio astronomy, and business processes. My recent research is at the intersection of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and data pipelines. In my everyday job, I work on system architecture, requirements elicitation, dependency management, and lifecycle planning.</p>


        <p> My previous research involved collaboration with stakeholders from several companies (e.g., TNO, TomTom, Siemens), governmental agencies (e.g., NWO), and project partners (e.g., the i-CAVE consortium, which comprises over 50 companies and four universities). Since 2024, I  have been serving on <a href="https://www.versen.nl/contents/board">the executive board of the Dutch National Association for Software Engineering</a>. </p>


<p>If you are a master student looking for thesis projects, contact me over email</p>
